**/drop**
Use with care! Will drop user and home collection! Is used to reset the database for testing purposes. If you need to recreate users ONLY. This will get the side effect that old tokens will not be valid for POSTMAN collection, for the newly created users you have to copy the token and update the POSTMAN environment variables. Same goes for POSTMAN methods to newly created homes with links /homes/:id, were :id needs to be updated. To do this use method GET /homes to retrieve the ids under links object in the body response.
